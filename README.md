This is the code of Medical image reconstruction with multi-level deep learning denoiser and tight frame regularization, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 2024. 

Here are two versions of our code. Version 1 is with the pre-trained models, version 2 may be more simple. The code is mainly written by Shilong Jia. 

In this code, we call the MWCNN and other compared deep methods by the matconvnet. Please make sure that your matlab is equipped with matconvnet.

Our environment is: matconvnet-1.0-beta25
